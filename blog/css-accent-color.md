**What is `accent-color`?**

The `accent-color` CSS property applies a user-specified accent color to certain form controls and UI elements. This single line of CSS can drastically change the look and feel of your forms, aligning them with the visual identity of your website or application. Supported elements include:

- `<input type="checkbox">`
- `<input type="radio">`
- `<input type="range">`
- `<progress>`

**Code Examples**

Let's see `accent-color` in action:

```css
/* Styles all supported form controls  */
input[type="checkbox"],
input[type="radio"],
input[type="range"],
progress {
  accent-color: #ff6347; /* A bright orange color */
}

/* Individual element styling */
input[type="radio"] {
  accent-color: green;
}
```

**Benefits of using `accent-color`**

- **Simplified Styling:** With `accent-color`, achieving a consistent look across different form controls becomes remarkably easy. No more custom classes or complex CSS manipulation.
- **Branding:** Effortlessly incorporate your brand colors into forms for a cohesive user experience.
- **Accessibility:** The `accent-color` property has built-in considerations for contrast and visibility. Users with visual impairments benefit from a clear and discernible interface.

**Using `accent-color` with `color-scheme`**

The `color-scheme` property allows you to declare support for light and dark modes. When used in conjunction with `accent-color`, you can create form styles that seamlessly adapt to the user's preferred color scheme.

```css
body {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

input[type="checkbox"] {
  accent-color: #ff6347; /* Light mode color */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  input[type="checkbox"] {
    accent-color: #00bcd4; /* Dark mode color */
  }
}
```

**Browser Support**

The `accent-color` property boasts excellent support across the latest versions of modern browsers. It's a safe choice to enhance your forms, but always refer to resources like Can I Use ([invalid URL removed]) for the most up-to-date compatibility information.

**Additional Considerations**

While `accent-color` provides a valuable tool for form control customization, it's important to exercise discretion. Ensure that the chosen accent colors maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility standards.

**Conclusion:**

The `accent-color` CSS property empowers web developers with an effective and straightforward way to style form controls. It promotes brand consistency, simplifies customization, and respects user preferences for light and dark mode. Embrace `accent-color` to take your user interfaces to the next level!
